# Municipal Vulnerability Index Guatemala

UNHCR Guatemala is building a composite indicator to assess the vulnerability of the 340 municipalities in the country. The main purpose of the index is to better prioritize the municipalities in which UNHCR should do Community-based Protection interventions.

There is an available https://github.com/martinepunhcr/MVI_Guatemala/wiki to review the metadata of all indicators used in the Index
